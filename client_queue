Client queues up to a configurable number of records in memory, defaulting to 1024
When memory hits queue limit records, those records are dumped to disk
As senders become available, they pull from disk first, then memory

On server error or disconnect, inflight messages are pushed back to memory

On shutdown, if the conn is open, the client takes 60 seconds to flush the queue
If after 60 seconds messages are still in memory, they're flushed to disk

On startup, the disk items from previous runs are treated like disk items written in this instance

As the disk queue grows while senders are unavailable due to the server being down or the client being misconfigured, logs are emitted for every 15 minutes during which a record send was attempted without any going over the wire

The memory queue can be configured to 0 items, which means items are always written to disk and then sent
